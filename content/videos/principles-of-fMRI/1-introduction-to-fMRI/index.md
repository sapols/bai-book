# Questions

## The Field

Q. Which intersections between Mind, Body, and Brain do cognitive, affective, and social neurosciences reside in?

A. Mind/Brain

Q. What research problem can you think of that may reside in the intersection of all three of Mind, Body, and Brain?

A. Problems relating to free will. E.g., "Do you as a conscious individual decide to move your body or does an unconscious facet of your brain move it for you?"

Q. Which community of experts do you identify yourself with (one or more)?

A. Computer Scientists / (to a lesser extent) Data Scientists

## Modalities

Q. What are the two major categories of brain imaging?

A. Structural and Functional brain imaging

Q. What type of brain imaging is more commonly used to study the effects of strokes?

A. Structural

Q. What is one major difference between MRI and fMRI in terms of data structure?

A. fMRI takes sequences of images over time, MRI does not.

## Spatial and Temporal Resolutions

Q. What are possible modalities to study a phenomenon that changes around every 10 seconds?

A. BOLD fMRI and ASL fMRI

Q. What are possible modalities to study a phenomenon that changes every second?

A. MEG and EEG. BOLD fMRI looks just out of range.

Q. To study activities within a brain area about the size of a finger tip, what modalities are possible?

A. BOLD fMRI, possibly ASL fMRI. PET looks just out of range.

Q. To study activities within a brain area about the size of needle at a sample rate of 10 hertz, what modalities are possible?

A. Possibly BOLD fMRI, but the chart in the video doesn't show any modalities that overlap a tenth of a second and less than a cm, so I'd guess there are actually none.
