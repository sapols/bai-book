    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "I have a pretty strong background in machine learning (ML). I became interested in it toward the end of my undergrad in CS, and I ended up watching enough YouTube videos to grok the basics. Then in grad school, both of my semesters of Independent Study related to ML in some way. In my first semester, I researched methods of detecting anomalies in spacecraft telemetry with unsupervised ML algorithms. I work at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) here in Boulder, which allowed me to conduct that research using real satellite telemetry. I wrote [a paper](https://github.com/sapols/Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection/blob/master/Paper/Unsupervised%20Machine%20Learning%20for%20Spacecraft%20Anomaly%20Detection%20in%20WebTCAD.pdf) on my findings and LASP liked my work enough that now, as part of my day job, I'm building a protoype of the software that will be used by mission ops personnel at LASP. In my second semester, I joined the Laboratory for Playful Computation under Dr. Ben Shapiro and, with a two fellow students, worked on a project that explored how ML could be integrated into youths' K-12 computing education. In short, I helped develop an app that can train and recognize gestures via a micro:bit, then connected that app to Scratch to afford gesture-based input for games, then ran a series of workshops with children where they built gesture-controlled Scratch games. We're planning on publishing a paper at this year's IDC, but it's not done yet, so I'll share a [demo video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12hJX06XVy6vSv8wqGQws3p1xR2VWPpOh) instead.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Neuroimaging\n",
    "I have absolutely no background in Neuroimaging. I might understand the concepts better than a lay person because I think it's facinating and I listen to tons of science podcasts, but I have no formal training in the subject. Pretty much everything I know was either picked up by podcasts or YouTube videos about people controlling things with their minds (via headsets of some kind). I also watched Elon Musk's full Neuralink presentation recently, which was pretty informative. I don't know the different parts of the brain, nor the various ways the brain can be imaged, nor many such basics. "
