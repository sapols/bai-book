<p>Q. Does the peak at 5 second indicate the time of the highest neural activity? If so, how? If not, why not?</p>
<p>A. Probably, because BOLD signals usually (but not always) correlate with neural activity.</p>
<p>Q. Suppose we choose a TR of 500ms. Roughly at which frame (e.g., 5th, 10th, 15th ...etc) may we observe the peak response?</p>
<p>A. 5 seconds = 5000ms. 5000ms / 500ms = 10. So the 10th frame.</p>

<p>This graph is used to illustrate multiple issues related to nonlinearity. See if you can identify specific patterns or features in the graph that illustrate the said issues.</p>
<p>Q. Where in the graph can we see that there is no linearity if two stimuli are closer that 5 seconds?</p>
<p>A. Every curve</p>
<p>Q. Where in the graph can we there is non-linearity if two stimuli are more than 5 seconds apart?</p>
<p>A. Nowhere</p>
<p>Q. Where in the graph can we see the effect of saturation?</p>
<p>A. Everywhere, because the related secondary curves are about 1/2 as high as we'd expect with linearity.</p>
