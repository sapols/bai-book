Which intersections between Mind, Body, and Brain do cognitive, affective, and social neurosciences reside in?</p>
<p>A. Mind/Brain</p>
<p>Q. What research problem can you think of that may reside in the intersection of all three of Mind, Body, and Brain?</p>
<p>A. Problems relating to free will. E.g., "Do you as a conscious individual decide to move your body or does an unconscious facet of your brain move it for you?"</p>
<p>Q. Which community of experts do you identify yourself with (one or more)?</p>
<p>A. Computer Scientists / (to a lesser extent) Data Scientists</p>
<h2 id="Modalities">Modalities<a class="anchor-link" href="#Modalities"> </a></h2><p>Q. What are the two major categories of brain imaging?</p>
<p>A. Structural and Functional brain imaging</p>
<p>Q. What type of brain imaging is more commonly used to study the effects of strokes?</p>
<p>A. Structural</p>
<p>Q. What is one major difference between MRI and fMRI in terms of data structure?</p>
<p>A. fMRI takes sequences of images over time, MRI does not.</p>
<h2 id="Spatial-and-Temporal-Resolutions">Spatial and Temporal Resolutions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Spatial-and-Temporal-Resolutions"> </a></h2><p>Q. What are possible modalities to study a phenomenon that changes around every 10 seconds?</p>
<p>A. BOLD fMRI and ASL fMRI</p>
<p>Q. What are possible modalities to study a phenomenon that changes every second?</p>
<p>A. MEG and EEG. BOLD fMRI looks just out of range.</p>
<p>Q. To study activities within a brain area about the size of a finger tip, what modalities are possible?</p>
<p>A. BOLD fMRI, possibly ASL fMRI. PET looks just out of range.</p>
<p>Q. To study activities within a brain area about the size of needle at a sample rate of 10 hertz, what modalities are possible?</p>
<p>A. Possibly BOLD fMRI, but the chart in the video doesn't show any modalities that overlap a tenth of a second and less than a cm, so I'd guess there are actually none.</p>
